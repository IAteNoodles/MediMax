# Neo4j Graph Database Guidelines - COMPLETE REFERENCE

This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing the MediMax patient-centric knowledge graph. It is intended to be the single source of truth for developers writing Cypher queries.

**Database Statistics:**
- **Total Node Labels:** 18 (including variations)
- **Total Relationship Types:** 17
- **Graph Architecture:** Patient-centric with full medical data hierarchy

## 1. Core Concept: The Patient-Centric Graph

The entire graph is designed around the `Patient` node. Every piece of information, from a lab result to a medication, is directly or indirectly connected to a patient. This ensures that all data is contextualized within a specific individual's health journey. When querying, you will almost always start your traversal from a `Patient` node.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
1. **Patient Centricity:** All nodes are connected to patients (directly or indirectly)
2. **Hierarchical Structure:** Lab data follows Report → Study → Result hierarchy
3. **Clinical Relationships:** Symptoms, conditions, and medications are interlinked
4. **Temporal Tracking:** All entities include timestamps and historical data

## 5. Data Quality and Consistency Notes

### **Node Label Overlaps**
- `Patient` and `Person`: Identical structure, used interchangeably
- `Condition` and `MedicalHistory`: Same properties, different usage contexts
- `Medication` and `Treatment`: Identical structure, `Treatment` is broader category
- `Symptom` and `Observation`: Same properties, `Observation` more clinical
- `LabResult` and `TestResult`: Identical structure and usage
- `LabStudy` and `DiagnosticStudy`: Same properties and purpose

### **Key Identifier Patterns**
- All nodes have `patient_id` for patient linkage
- Lab-related nodes share `lab_report_id` for hierarchy
- Appointments have `appointment_id` for encounter linking
- Most nodes have `node_type` and `entity_type` for classification

### **Date/Time Handling**
- Dates stored as strings in YYYY-MM-DD format
- DateTime stamps include timezone information
- Always use date() function for date comparisons in queries

### **Boolean Properties**
- `is_abnormal`: Boolean for lab results
- `is_chronic`: Boolean for conditions
- `is_active`: Boolean for medications
- `graph_center`: String "True" for Patient nodes (not boolean)

## 6. Performance Optimization Guidelines

### **Indexing Recommendations**
```cypher
// Recommended indexes for optimal performance
CREATE INDEX patient_id_index FOR (p:Patient) ON (p.patient_id);
CREATE INDEX condition_patient_index FOR (c:Condition) ON (c.patient_id);
CREATE INDEX medication_patient_index FOR (m:Medication) ON (m.patient_id);
CREATE INDEX lab_report_patient_index FOR (lr:LabReport) ON (lr.patient_id);
CREATE INDEX symptom_patient_index FOR (s:Symptom) ON (s.patient_id);
```

### **Query Best Practices**
1. **Always start with Patient**: Use patient_id as entry point
2. **Use OPTIONAL MATCH**: For relationships that may not exist
3. **Limit result sets**: Use LIMIT for large datasets
4. **Filter early**: Apply WHERE clauses as early as possible
5. **Use relationship direction**: Specify direction for better performance
6. **Aggregate efficiently**: Use collect() for grouping related data

This comprehensive guide covers all 18 node types and 17 relationship types in the MediMax knowledge graph, providing complete property listings, usage patterns, and advanced querying examples for efficient graph traversal and analysis.
